### Structure of a Magisk Module

A typical Magisk module contains the following files and directories:
- `module.prop`
- `common`
- `service.sh`
- `post-fs-data.sh`
- `system` (or `system.prop`)

Here's a breakdown of each component:

### module.prop

This file contains metadata about the module. It is required and must follow a specific format.

Example `module.prop`:
```ini
id=your.module.id
name=Your Module Name
version=v1.0
versionCode=1
author=Your Name
description=A brief description of your module.
```

### common

This directory can contain shared scripts and functions used by `service.sh` and `post-fs-data.sh`.

Example `common/functions.sh`:
```sh
# Define a function to log messages
log_message() {
  log -t "MyModule" "$1"
}

# Define a function to copy files
copy_file() {
  cp -f $1 $2
  log_message "Copied $1 to $2"
}
```

### service.sh

This script runs in the background after the system has booted. It is useful for tasks that need to be done after the device is up and running.

Example `service.sh`:
```sh
#!/system/bin/sh
# Import common functions
. /data/adb/modules/your_module/common/functions.sh

# Your commands here
log_message "Service script running"
# Example task: remount system as read-write and copy a file
mount -o rw,remount /system
copy_file /data/adb/modules/your_module/system/etc/your_file /system/etc/your_file
mount -o ro,remount /system
```

### post-fs-data.sh

This script runs after the file system is mounted but before the device is fully booted. It is suitable for initial setups.

Example `post-fs-data.sh`:
```sh
#!/system/bin/sh
# Import common functions
. /data/adb/modules/your_module/common/functions.sh

# Your commands here
log_message "Post-fs-data script running"
# Example task: set a system property
setprop persist.example.property value
```

### system

This directory mimics the file system structure of the device. Files placed here will be overlaid onto the actual system partition.

Example structure:
```
system/
└── etc/
    └── your_file
```

## Detailed Explanation of Code Components

### module.prop

- **id:** A unique identifier for your module.
- **name:** The name of your module.
- **version:** The version of your module (human-readable).
- **versionCode:** A numerical version code for your module (used for updates).
- **author:** Your name or alias.
- **description:** A brief description of what your module does.

### service.sh

This script runs in the background after the device has fully booted. It’s useful for tasks that need to run continually or after boot.

```sh
#!/system/bin/sh
```
The shebang (`#!/system/bin/sh`) indicates that the script should be run in the shell environment.

```sh
. /data/adb/modules/your_module/common/functions.sh
```
This line sources the `functions.sh` script from the `common` directory, allowing you to use its functions.

```sh
log_message "Service script running"
```
This uses a custom logging function to log a message indicating that the service script is running.

```sh
mount -o rw,remount /system
copy_file /data/adb/modules/your_module/system/etc/your_file /system/etc/your_file
mount -o ro,remount /system
```
These commands remount the `/system` partition as read-write, copy a file from your module to the system directory, and then remount `/system` as read-only.

### post-fs-data.sh

This script runs early during the boot process, after the file system is mounted but before the device is fully booted.

```sh
#!/system/bin/sh
. /data/adb/modules/your_module/common/functions.sh
log_message "Post-fs-data script running"
setprop persist.example.property value
```
The script sources the `functions.sh` script, logs a message, and sets a system property.

### common/functions.sh

This script contains reusable functions that can be included in both `service.sh` and `post-fs-data.sh`.

```sh
log_message() {
  log -t "MyModule" "$1"
}
```
This function logs a message with a tag (`MyModule`).

```sh
copy_file() {
  cp -f $1 $2
  log_message "Copied $1 to $2"
}
```
This function copies a file from one location to another and logs the action.

### system

This directory contains files that will be overlaid onto the system partition. For example, placing a file in `system/etc/` will result in that file being available in `/etc/` on the device.

## Packaging Your Module

To package your module, ensure all files are in the correct structure and create a ZIP file:

Example:
```
your_module.zip
│
├── module.prop
├── service.sh
├── post-fs-data.sh
├── common/
│   └── functions.sh
└── system/
    └── etc/
        └── your_file
```

1. Navigate to the root directory of your module.
2. Create a ZIP file:
   ```sh
   zip -r your_module.zip .
   ```

## Conclusion

Understanding the structure and purpose of each component in a Magisk module is crucial for developing effective and reliable modules. By following this guide, you can create, customize, and package your Magisk modules for distribution and use. Happy coding!
